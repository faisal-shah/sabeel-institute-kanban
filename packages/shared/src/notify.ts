 * which Android labels **"Miscellaneous"** in the app's notification settings.
 * That fallback is exactly what was happening: the app created a channel called
 * "Default" that nothing ever posted to, because the server sent no channel at
 * all.
 *
 * IMPORTANCE_HIGH is not a change in behaviour — it is what the fallback channel
 * already used, so keeping it means nobody's notifications go quiet. It also has
 * to be right FIRST TIME: Android fixes a channel's importance when it is
 * created and an app may never raise it afterwards, only the person can. That is
 * also why this is a new channel id rather than a correction to the old one,
 * which already exists at DEFAULT importance on every device that has run the
