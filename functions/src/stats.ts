/**
 * Usage counters for the Stats screen.
 *
 * Counting happens AS EVENTS HAPPEN rather than in a nightly sweep, for three
 * reasons. A sweep cannot see a file REMOVAL at all — the attachment document is
 * gone by midnight, so there is nothing left to scan. Counting on write also
 * means today's bucket is already correct, so there is no "compute the current
 * day live" path to build and no way for it to disagree with the stored history.
 * And the volume does not justify a job: the whole organisation generates on the
 * order of ten events a day.
 *
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE RULE THIS FILE EXISTS TO ENFORCE: counting must never be able to damage,
 * block, or duplicate the thing it counts.
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `recordStat` NEVER REJECTS. That is not defensive habit, it is load-bearing,
 * and the reason is specific to this codebase:
 *
 *   `guardedEvent` reports to Sentry and RETHROWS, so a throw inside a Firestore
 *   trigger makes Firebase retry the whole trigger. `onCardWritten` writes
 *   activity entries with GENERATED document ids, so a retry does not repair
 *   anything — it writes a second copy of every activity line on the card.
 *
 * So a failed counter must never propagate: riding along in the caller's batch,
 * or throwing out of it, would let a statistics bug corrupt a card's history or
 * fail a colleague's upload. It is called after the primary work has committed,
 * and it swallows its own failures.
 *
 * The trade is explicit and accepted: a failure here is a MISSED COUNT, never a
 * broken app. Sentry sees it, so drift is visible rather than silent, and
 * `scripts/backfill-stats.mjs` can rebuild any range from the source documents
 * — cards, comments, attachments and the activity log all still exist. The one
 * number that cannot be rebuilt is `bytesRemoved`: the activity log records that
 * a file was detached and its name, not its size.
