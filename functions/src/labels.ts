/**
 * Deleting an org-wide label.
 *
 * Labels live at `labels/{labelId}` and cards reference them by id, so removing
 * one is never a single-document act: every card carrying it has to let go of
 * it too. That is why `firestore.rules` denies client deletes outright.
 *
 * Three things a client could not do here:
 *  - Sweep across boards it cannot read. Only an admin may delete a label and
 *    only an admin reads every board — but the sweep must be complete regardless
 *    of who runs it, and the Admin SDK is what makes that guaranteed rather than
 *    incidental.
 *  - Name the actor. A delete TRIGGER cannot — Firestore does not tell it who
 *    performed the delete — which is the same reason attachment deletion is a
 *    callable rather than a trigger.
 *  - Stay recoverable if it fails halfway. See the ordering note below.
