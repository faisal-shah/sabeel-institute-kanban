/**
 * The anomaly canary.
 *
 * Backups retain 98 days and PITR covers the last 7, but retention only helps if
 * the problem is NOTICED while a good backup still exists. The bad case is a
 * corruption just before a quiet period — every later backup faithfully captures
 * the already-broken state, and by the time anyone looks the last good one has
 * aged out. Extending retention is the expensive lever; noticing sooner is the
 * cheap one, and 98 days is generous if detection takes days.
 *
 * So once a day this counts documents per collection, compares against the
 * previous run, and raises to Sentry when a count drops more than that collection
 * tolerates. It also sends a Sentry cron check-in, so the job going SILENT is
 * itself an alert — a job that never runs never reports its own failure.
 *
 * Deliberately not a UI feature: "cards fell 40%" is an operator signal, not
 * something an admin inside the app can act on.

 * this cannot be aligned against it; nothing here depends on that ordering.
 *
 * The zone is ORG_TIMEZONE, not a second copy of it. It was hardcoded here, and
 * when the org zone moved this one silently did not — at which point "well clear
 * of the 08:00 run" was reasoning across two different clocks and no longer
