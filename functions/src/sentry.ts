/**
 * Error reporting for Cloud Functions.
 *
 * Ported from the sibling time tracker deliberately — the same three properties
 * are what make it useful there, and each is easy to get wrong:
 *
 *  1. The DSN is a **Secret Manager secret**, not an env var in the repo. Bind
 *     it with `secrets: [sentryDsn]` on any function whose failures matter.
 *  2. `HttpsError` is EXCLUDED. Those are expected domain outcomes —
 *     unauthenticated, permission-denied, invalid-argument — and they already
 *     reach the caller. Reporting them would bury real defects under a stream of
 *     people mistyping things.
 *  3. Events are **flushed before returning**. A serverless instance can be
 *     frozen the moment the handler resolves, so an unflushed event may never
 *     leave the machine. This is the one that fails silently in production and
 *     looks like "Sentry isn't working".
