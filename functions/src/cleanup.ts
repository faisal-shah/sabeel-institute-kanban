 * Delete a card's `comments` and `activity` when the card itself is deleted, and
 * unlink any subtasks that pointed at it.
 *
 * Firestore does NOT cascade: deleting `cards/{cardId}` leaves its subcollections
 * behind as orphans forever (unreadable — the rules resolve their board from the
 * now-missing card doc and deny). A hard delete is board owners and admins only, but it
 * happens, and without this every deletion leaks its whole thread and history.
 *
 * `recursiveDelete` removes the (already-gone) card doc AND every descendant, so
 * it clears exactly the leftover subcollections. Idempotent: re-running on an
 * empty path is a no-op.
