/**
 * Card history, written by the server so it cannot be forged.
 *
 * Clients have no write access to `activity` at all (see firestore.rules), which
 * is what makes "Sara moved this to Done" trustworthy. The actor is taken from
 * the card's own `updatedBy`, which rules require to match the writer.
 *
 * This trigger is not the ONLY writer any more: the attachment callables append
 * their own `attached`/`detached` entries (functions/src/attachments.ts). What
 * makes the log trustworthy is the client write ban, not the number of
 * server-side writers — and a delete trigger could not have supplied the actor,
 * since Firestore does not tell it who performed the delete.
 *
 * The diffing itself lives in @sabeel/shared and is tested exhaustively there —
 * notably that a rank-only change (a reorder within a column) produces NO entry.
