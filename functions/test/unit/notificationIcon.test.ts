/**
 * Two components draw a push on Android, and each reads its own manifest keys.
 *
 * A message that arrives with the app in the background or closed is drawn by
 * the FCM SDK from `com.google.firebase.messaging.default_notification_*`. One
 * that arrives with the app OPEN reaches `onMessageReceived` instead and is
 * drawn by expo-notifications — `notify.ts`'s handler says to show it — from
 * `expo.modules.notifications.default_notification_*`; with that pair absent,
 * `ExpoNotificationBuilder` falls back to `applicationInfo.icon`, the launcher
 * mipmap, with no tint. Both paths post the notification, correctly worded, on
 * the right channel, so nothing fails — the app just shows two different small
 * icons depending on whether it happened to be open, which is what a phone
 * showed on 2026-09-16 with only the FCM pair set.
 *
 * No suite renders a status bar, and a device pass sends its test push to a
 * closed app, which is the configured path — so the foreground presenter was
 * never exercised and nothing could catch the split. This is the check that
 * can: it reads the manifest and holds the two pairs to one resource. It goes
 * red if either expo key is dropped, or pointed somewhere else, or the icon is
 * ever the launcher mipmap — the exact three ways the drift can come back.
 *
 * Paths resolve from the functions workspace, which is vitest's cwd here — the
 * same convention `emulatorPorts.test.ts` uses.
