/**
 * THE `<mention>` SHAPE IS AN UNDOCUMENTED OUTPUT OF A NATIVE LIBRARY.
 *
 * `packages/shared/src/richtextHtml.ts` converts the native editor's mention
 * node back to `@handle`, and to do that it has to know that
 * `react-native-enriched-html` writes the indicator into an ATTRIBUTE rather
 * than into the element's text:
 *
 *     <mention text="sara" indicator="@">sara</mention>
 *
 * That shape appears in no public API. `setMention(indicator, text, attributes)`
 * is documented; what it serialises to is not. Our converter depends on it
 * anyway, because it must.
 *
 * The unit tests in `packages/shared/test/richtextHtml.test.ts` assert the
 * conversion — but they assert it against a shape WE wrote down, so they would
 * all keep passing if the library renamed the attribute tomorrow, while
 * production silently went back to notifying nobody. That is the same failure
 * this bug already had once: green tests, correct-looking UI, no notification.
 *
 * So this test couples to the library's own source instead. It is deliberately
 * a coarse instrument: it fails on an upgrade, and a failure means "go and
 * re-verify the shape on a device, then update the converter AND the tests" —
 * not "edit this file until it passes".
 *
 * Lives in `app/` because that workspace runs plain `.ts` unit tests and this
 * asserts about an installed dependency rather than about our own code.
