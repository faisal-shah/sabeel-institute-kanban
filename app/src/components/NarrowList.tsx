/**
 * A list you narrow by typing, then pick from.
 *
 * The same shape the card screen's assignee and subtask pickers are built from
 * — a field, a list, and rows that say what picking them does. It is a component
 * here because the Filters sheet needs it three times over (boards, labels,
 * people) and three copies of a filter-and-pick loop is how three slightly
 * different behaviours get written by accident. Those two older pickers are NOT
 * on it: each carries behaviour this does not have (creating a label from the
 * field, excluding a card's own subtree), so migrating them is its own change
 * rather than a claim to make here.
 *
 * `PickerList`, never a hand-rolled `ScrollView`, wherever this scrolls at all:
 * a capped scroller under a FOCUSED `TextField` eats the tap on the row being
 * picked — the row does not even light up — and `PickerList` exists because that
 * was found three separate times. See its own note in `ui.tsx`, and `bounded`
 * below for when it should not scroll at all.

   * on iOS: the inner one takes the pan and does NOT chain, so a drag over the
   * rows stops dead at the end of the inner list while the rest of the sheet
   * sits below, reachable only by starting the drag somewhere else. Web chains
   * and Android has `nestedScrollEnabled`, so a green web sweep says nothing
   * about it. One scroller, and the sheet scrolls as one list; a long list is
   * what the narrowing field above is for.
   *
   * Dropping `PickerList` here does NOT drop what it protects: the tap a focused
   * `TextField` makes a scroller eat is governed by `keyboardShouldPersistTaps`,
   * and the scroller that remains — `Sheet`'s body — sets it to `'handled'`
   * already, for that exact reason and at length. Passing `false` anywhere the
   * remaining scroller does not is how the bug comes back.
   *
   * `true` for a list on a plain screen, where nothing else is scrolling and the
   * cap is what stops a long list pushing the page down.
