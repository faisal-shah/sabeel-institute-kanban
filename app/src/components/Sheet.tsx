/**
 * A centred, size-bounded dialog.
 *
 * Replaces an absolutely-positioned panel pinned to the bottom of the screen,
 * which could not be fully seen on a short viewport: its content ran past the
 * bottom edge with no way to reach it, and enlarging the window did not reliably
 * help because the panel grew with its content.
 *
 * The rules that fixes are worth stating, because they apply to every overlay:
 *
 *  - Bound the height (a fraction of the viewport) and scroll INSIDE it, so the
 *    dialog can never be taller than the screen however many options it has.
 *  - Centre it rather than pinning to an edge, so a keyboard rising from the
 *    bottom cannot cover it.
 *  - Give it a dismissing backdrop, so it is never possible to get stuck behind.
 *
 * Uses RN's Modal, which renders in a top layer on both platforms. An
 * absolutely-positioned View is still subject to its parent's clipping and
 * stacking context, which was the other half of why the old panel misbehaved.

        The backdrop is a POINTER affordance only — deliberately NOT a button.

        `accessibilityRole="button"` does not merely add an ARIA role on web:
        react-native-web maps it to a real <button> ELEMENT
        (AccessibilityUtil/propsToAccessibilityComponent). So this wrapper became
        a <button> containing the whole dialog — including its TextInput. Nesting
        interactive content inside a button is invalid HTML, and the browser
        resolved it by treating a space typed in the field as activating the
        button: the sheet dismissed mid-word. It cost a label called "waiting on"
        its space, and it applied to every sheet with a field in it — the link
        dialog too. Native RN renders no button element and has no key
        activation, which is why Android never showed it.

        Verified in both directions on the real app: with the role, typing a
        space closes the sheet; without it, the space lands in the field. Do not
        restore the role to make the backdrop "accessible" — it never was. The
        sheet has a real Cancel button, and `onRequestClose` handles Escape on
        web and Back on Android, which are the routes keyboards and assistive
        tech actually use.

            `keyboardShouldPersistTaps` IS WHAT MAKES THE BUTTONS IN HERE WORK.

            At its default — `'never'` — a ScrollView with a focused TextInput
            inside it takes the responder in the CAPTURE phase and eats the
            touch. React Native says so in its own source: "the first tap should
            be sent to the scroll view and dismiss the keyboard, then the second
            tap goes to the actual interior view". A `Pressable` under the
            finger therefore never becomes responder — it does not even show its
            pressed state — and `onPress` never runs.

            Every sheet in this app is a field followed by the button that acts
            on it, so that default eats the tap the user actually came to make.
            Filmed on a phone in the link dialog: three taps on Add link over
            3.5 seconds, the first two with the button at full opacity (no press
            state) and the third at 0.8 (pressed) — and only that one worked.

            Worse here than the RN comment implies, because it does not stop at
            one tap: the guard is `a TextInput is focused AND a keyboard may be
            open`, and the second half is `_keyboardMetrics != null`, cleared by
            `keyboardDidHide` — an event this app does not reliably get under
            edge-to-edge (see the `expo-firebase-stack` skill). The keyboard
            goes away, the field keeps focus, and the ScrollView goes on eating
            taps with nothing on screen to explain why.

            `'handled'` is the value that means what a dialog wants: a tap a
            child handles reaches it, and a tap nothing handles still dismisses
            the keyboard.
