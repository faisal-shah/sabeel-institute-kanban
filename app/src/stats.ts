 * reads the same way for the same reason.
 *

 * /stats/{scope}`, which does not authorize a collection-group read; it would
 * need a `match /{path=**}/months/{month}` recursive rule. Widening a rule to
 * save a round trip on an admin-only screen with under twenty boards is not a
 * trade worth making.
 *
 * SETTLES rather than rejecting: one unreadable scope must not blank a
 * breakdown that is otherwise correct, and a SHORT list rendered as if complete
 * is exactly the kind of quiet wrong this screen has been bitten by before. A
 * scope that failed is simply absent from the result — and since a scope that
 * SUCCEEDS always yields one document per month, an absent scope is exactly a
 * failed one, which is how the caller counts them without a tally riding along
 * that could disagree with the documents beside it.
