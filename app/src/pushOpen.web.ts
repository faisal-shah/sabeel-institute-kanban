/**
 * Taps on a push notification — WEB (native sibling: pushOpen.ts).
 *
 * Inert, deliberately — but no longer because nothing arrives. A VAPID key IS
 * deployed (verified in the live bundle), and permission is now asked from a
 * press rather than from a snapshot callback, so browsers DO receive these.
 *
 * What is still missing is a destination. The web app has no URL handling for
 * board and card ids, so `firebase-messaging-sw.js` deliberately focuses the
 * app on click instead of opening a link that would look meaningful and land on
 * the home screen anyway. The ids are already in `event.notification.data`, and
 * that handler — not this file — is where routing goes when the web app grows
 * URLs for them. Until then a tapped web push opens the app, and the
 * notification is in Alerts either way.
 *
 * The seam exists so App.tsx mounts one hook for both platforms instead of
 * branching on Platform.OS.
