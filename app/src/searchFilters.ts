/**
 * What Search is currently filtering by — held OUTSIDE React.
 *
 * `App.tsx` renders one screen per route, so pushing a card unmounts
 * `SearchScreen` and every `useState` in it dies. Coming back re-mounted an
 * empty screen: the text gone, the chips off, the label picks lost. Back is
 * supposed to return you to what you were looking at, and nothing about the
 * navigation stack was wrong — the state simply has to outlive the component.
 *
 * So it lives here, in a module, with the same shape `nav.ts` uses: one
 * variable, a set of listeners, and a hook that subscribes. No new concept, and
 * no provider to thread through the tree.
 *
 * SESSION ONLY. Nothing is persisted: a filter you set last week is not a filter
 * you meant to still be looking through today, and the app reloading is the
 * natural moment to forget. Within a session it survives everything — a card, a
 * different tab, a rotation — until the clear control on the screen is used, or
 * until somebody signs out (see `session.ts`, which resets the view stores for
 * the same reason it clears the live-query cache).

 *
 * The rule is that every active filter is visible and removable, even a broken

 * go stale: `deleteLabel` removes a label mid-filter, archiving a board drops it
 * out of `useMyBoards`, and `removeBoardMember` can take away the last board a
