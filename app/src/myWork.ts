/**
 * Every card assigned to me, across every board — the cross-board "My Work"

 *
 * Cards are a top-level collection, so this is a plain COLLECTION query. Two
 * things make it work:
 *
 *  1. The `array-contains` constraint on my own uid is mandatory. Rules only
 *     permit a list they can prove is restricted to the caller (the read rule's
 *     assignee arm); an unconstrained `collection('cards')` would be every card
 *     in the organisation and is rejected outright.
 *
 *  2. The board id is now a FIELD on the card; the board NAME is resolved from
 *     the caller's own board list. That works because assignment implies board
 *     membership, so every board appearing here is already one the user can see
 *     — which is why no board name is denormalised onto cards and no fan-out is
 *     needed when a board is renamed.
 *
 * The `archived` filter is applied client-side rather than in the query so the
 * whole thing needs only the automatic single-field array index.
