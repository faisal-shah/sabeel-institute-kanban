 * native component, which meant a tablet running the Android app got the phone's
 * swipe layout despite having room for four columns, and a phone browser got the
 * desktop drag board on a 380px screen. "Android" is not a synonym for "small",
 * and "web" is not a synonym for "large".
 *
 * Platform still decides one thing — whether HTML5 drag-and-drop exists — but
 * that is a CAPABILITY, layered on top of a layout chosen by width.

 * The wide board scrolls horizontally, so it needs room for TWO columns to be
 * useful, not all of them: 2 x 300px + gutter + screen padding is about 648.
 *
 * Chosen against real device profiles rather than by feel (see
 * scripts/device-shots.mjs). The binding case is the Galaxy Tab S4 at 712px
 * portrait — a 10.5" tablet, which at a 768 breakpoint fell to the phone's
 * one-column layout despite easily fitting two. The largest phone in the set is
 * the iPhone 14 Pro Max at 430px, so there is a wide margin before any handset
