 * Wire Android's hardware Back — and the edge-swipe gesture, which raises the

 *
 * A hand-rolled stack is invisible to Android, so without this the OS sees an
 * activity with nothing to pop and EXITS the app from any screen. Opening a
 * card and swiping back closed the whole app instead of returning to the board.
 *
 * Returning true consumes the event. Returning false at the root deliberately
 * lets Android do its normal thing and leave the app, which is what people
 * expect from the first screen.
 *
 * `BackHandler` is a no-op shim under react-native-web, so this is safe to call
 * unconditionally. Browser Back is a SEPARATE gap: this stack pushes no history
 * entries, so the browser's back button still leaves the site — that needs
 * history integration, noted at the top of this module.
