 * project — which is the only reason there is a window to check in.
 *
 * There is deliberately no sign-up affordance anywhere in this app, and no
 * message here naming where to get an account. Both stores stop requiring in-app
 * account deletion only while the app neither creates an account nor points at
 * somewhere that does, and "sign in on the website first" is the second of those
 * two triggers stated almost verbatim. The instruction belongs in the onboarding
 * email. See docs/STORE-RELEASE.md before adding anything friendlier here.

 * the web half and keeps creating accounts, which is why nothing here has to
