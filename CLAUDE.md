# Sabeel Institute Kanban — Working Rules for Claude

## What this project is

A kanban board application for Sabeel Institute (small nonprofit, <50 internal
users), replacing ClickUp. Faisal is the developer; the nonprofit's staff are the
admins and board owners in the app. **The phases are finished and the app is in
production.**

Source of truth: `docs/PRODUCT_BRIEF.md` (decisions & data model),
`docs/PERMISSIONS.md` (who can do what), `docs/PHASE_STATUS.md` (live build
status and the deploy log).

## Stack knowledge lives in a shared skill, not here

Recurring traps of this stack live in the **`expo-firebase-stack` skill** —
`../agent-skills/skills/expo-firebase-stack/`, a **PUBLIC** repo.
`docs/STACK-GOTCHAS.md` is a stub for that reason: a stub cannot drift.

**The boundary is one question: would this be true for a different company on
the same stack?** Yes → the skill. No → this file. Nothing naming this project
goes into the skill.

Its closing section, **"How this stack fools you"**, is the one to read *before*
debugging anything subtle. The recurring shape is that **failures imitate
success**: APIs that run and do nothing (`Keyboard` events under edge-to-edge,
RNW's unthemeable `Switch`, a stale `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` in the Metro cache),
verification steps that counterfeit the result, a green web suite that says
nothing about a native layout bug, and resources that report "deployed" while
not working. **Prove the mechanism ran before concluding a fix was insufficient,
re-test without touching anything, and reproduce on the surface that is actually
broken.**

When something here costs real time, **write the entry into the skill** —
symptom-first — in the same batch as the fix, not only into a commit message.

The skill also carries `tools/bootstrap-linux.sh`, which installs this whole
toolchain on a fresh machine under `$HOME` with no root, and `tools/check-host.sh`.
See `docs/DEVELOPING.md`.

Sibling project `../sabeel-institute-time-tracker/` is the reference
implementation for every convention here — read its files directly rather than
trusting a summary when the details matter. `docs/INHERITED-STACK.md` records
what carries over and, more importantly, what was learned the hard way there.

# Product invariants

Do not silently change any of these.

## Scope and shape

- **Restraint is the feature.** They left ClickUp because of interface bloat. No
  dashboards, integrations, automations, alternate board views, or time tracking.
  Every addition must justify itself against "does the team actually use this?" —
  when in doubt, leave it out and ask.
- **No board limit**, anywhere in the model, UI, or rules — the 5-board cap was a
  reason they're leaving.
- **Phone-first, not phone-compatible.** The mobile board is its own layout (one
  column at a time, swipe between columns), not a squeezed desktop board. Every
  feature ships with a phone design.
- **No WIP limits, no card start dates.** Both considered, both declined.
- **Boards archive, never hard-delete. Cards can be deleted, but only by that
  board's owners and admins** — members archive.
- **The team is in Houston — `ORG_TIMEZONE` is `America/Chicago`.** It shipped as
  `America/New_York` and nothing surfaced it: due dates are all-day strings, so
  the only symptoms were cards turning overdue an hour early and the due-soon
  reminder firing at 07:00 local. Do not "align" it with the sibling
  time-tracker — that project has no org timezone at all, by design, because it
  buckets each entry in the timezone where the work happened.

## Authority is TWO independent things

Changed 2026-08-16, replacing three org roles alone. An **org role** — admin /
organizer / member — and **ownership of one board**, a `boardOwnerUids` array on
the board document. They are orthogonal: a plain member can own a board, an
organizer can own none.

`organizer` grants EXACTLY ONE thing, creating a board; label curation and Stats
are admin-only; **only an admin sees a board they were not added to**. Everything
about one board — settings, columns, membership, ownership, archiving,
permanently deleting a card, deleting anyone's comment — is its owners plus
admins. `docs/PERMISSIONS.md` is the full statement; **do not restate the table
anywhere else.**

Three things that are load-bearing rather than tidy:

- **The creator is protected.** Only an admin may take `createdBy` out of
  `boardOwnerUids`, including on their own behalf — and the rule is phrased on
  the CHANGE, so a board whose creator an admin already demoted stays editable,
  which a value-shaped rule would have bricked. It checks BOTH lists, because
  authority is `member AND owner` and nothing makes the two move together.
- **Ownership is always checked WITH membership**, never alone, which is what
  lets the rules skip a `boardOwnerUids ⊆ memberUids` subset check. The subset
  does hold — `removeBoardMember` clears both — but it holds because that code is
  right, and rules cannot check an Admin SDK batch; a subset RULE would turn any
  lapse there, or any restore predating the shape, into a board that bounces the
  next client write. The pairing makes the same lapse inert instead.
- **`memberUids` and `memberProfiles` NEVER change from a client**, admins
  included: both directions are callables. Removal belongs to one because it
  clears assignments and subscriptions in the same batch — without that a board
  write could strand both, leaving a removed person read access through the card
  rule's assignee arm. Adding became one on 2026-08-20 because it did not work:
  rules let only admins `list` users, so a non-admin owner had nothing to pick
  from though the write was permitted. The server now supplies the profile too,
  which is the only way to stop an owner writing an arbitrary name against a uid.

And **board create REQUIRES `boardOwnerUids == [creator]`**, which turns "an app
too old to know about ownership made a board only an admin can manage" from
silent and permanent into a loud failure.

**Sign-in is restricted to `@oursabeel.com` AND still needs admin approval.** The
domain check is server-side — the client `hd` hint is UX, not a boundary.

## Assignees, subscriptions and labels

- **Assignees must be board members**, rules-enforced. This is what makes the
  cross-board "My Work" collection-group query legal without a parent lookup —
  breaking it breaks My Work's security model.
- **Subscribing to a card means subscribing to its COMMENTS** (added 2026-07-28,
  narrowing the older "no watchers" decision rather than overturning it). Nothing
  else about the card notifies a subscriber — notifying on every change was
  considered and dropped, because `myCardMoved` already ships off for firing
  constantly and ten more triggers beside it would be worse. An assignee may also
  subscribe, which is how the interest survives being unassigned.
  **`subscriberUids` is a grant of READ** — the card read rule has a subscriber
  arm so the cross-board query needs no per-row board lookup — so it carries
  every constraint `assigneeUids` does: members only, cleared by
  `removeBoardMember`, filtered on a cross-board move, and absent from a copy.
- **Labels are ORG-WIDE, not per board** (changed 2026-07-27). One `labels/{id}`
  collection every board shares; a card's `labelIds` mean the same thing wherever
  the card is, so a cross-board move and copy **carry them** — the old code
  cleared them and must not come back. **Any active member creates** one (from
  the `+` in a card's label picker, since Board Settings opens for that board's
  owners alone); **ADMINS rename, recolour and delete** — the effect is org-wide,
  reaching cards on boards the editor cannot open, so the authority is org-wide
  too. Deleting is a callable that strips the id from every card first and only
  then removes the document — reversed, a failure would leave cards pointing at
  nothing findable. A COLLECTION rather than an array on a config doc: concurrent
  creates are the normal case here, and an array field would lose writes.
  Uniqueness is case-insensitive and client-checked only; a simultaneous
  double-create making two same-named labels is an accepted residual.

## Attachments

Added 2026-07-26, reversing the original "no attachments" decision. Multiple
files per card, **10 MB each**, any type. **Any active member of the board may
remove one** — deliberately NOT the owner-only gate permanent card deletion uses,
because attaching the wrong file is an ordinary mistake that should not need
someone else to undo. Plain rows, no inline previews. Attach and remove are both
recorded in the card's activity log.

**Storage rules cannot read Firestore, and everything about attachments follows
from that.** Board membership is a Firestore document, so `storage.rules` can
only ask "is this an active account". Therefore: the attachment DOCUMENT is the
upload's authorization (creating it is membership-checked, and the object goes to
a path derived from ids only that create could produce); objects are
**write-once and unreadable**; every download is a short-lived **V4 signed URL**
minted by a callable that repeats the membership check. Never
`getDownloadURL()` — its token never expires, so anyone who saw a link would keep
access after leaving a board. Clients cannot update or delete an attachment: a
client delete would strand the bytes, and a delete trigger cannot name who did it.

**Two accepted residuals, both measured, neither a bug to re-fix.** A signed URL
already handed out keeps working for up to an hour after someone is removed from
a board — individual signed URLs cannot be revoked, only the signing key rotated,
which would kill every URL at once. And there is **no cap on how many files a
card may hold**: the 10 MB limit is per file, so cost is bounded only by the
budget alert. Both are fine for fewer than fifty colleagues; neither survives
contact with untrusted users.

## Descriptions and comments are rich text

- **MARKDOWN, restricted to FIVE elements** (changed 2026-07-30, reversing the
  2026-07-20 plain-text decision on the explicit request that decision named).
  Bold, italic, bullet list, ordered list, link. **Nothing else** — no headings,
  code, quotes, underline, strikethrough, tables or checklists, and no images
  because attachments cover those. The vocabulary is small because the team's
  real content needed nothing more (measured, not assumed) and because a small
  vocabulary is what makes the round trip provable.
  `packages/shared/src/richtext.ts` is the one definition; `RICH_VOCABULARY` is
  the list.
- **Markdown is storage the user never sees.** Both editors are WYSIWYG with a
  toolbar. Nobody types syntax — that was the whole objection to markdown in
  2026-07-20 and it still stands.
- **ESCAPING IS THE CORRECTNESS CORE, not a detail.** The escape set is exactly
  the parse set: `\`, `*`, `[` and a line-leading `-`/`+`/`N.`. Deliberately NOT
  `_`, backtick or `~` — outside the vocabulary, so escaping them would store
  `snake\_case\_name`, noise in a field a backfill script will one day read. The
  hand-written list is **not** the correctness criterion; the criterion is
  `parseRich(serializeRich(doc))` equalling `doc`, enforced by seeded fuzz. Add a
  character to one list and you must add it to the other.
- **Autolinking of bare URLs is RENDER-TIME ONLY.** Storage keeps exactly what
  was typed. If either editor rewrote a bare URL, the same keystrokes would store
  different bytes on a phone than in a browser — which is why `linkRegex={null}`
  on native and no AutoLink plugin on web.
- **The editor is the ONLY thing split by platform.** Lexical on web,
  `react-native-enriched-html` on Android, both behind one markdown-in/
  markdown-out contract and one `richtextHtml` seam. The renderer, toolbar,
  mention policy and converter are shared — `RichText` in particular must never
  gain a `.web` sibling, or the two surfaces could disagree about what a card
  says. `docs/RESEARCH-RICH-TEXT.md` records why, and what the spike measured.

## Brand, theme and UI conventions

**BRAND COLORS ARE FIXED.** `docs/BRAND.md` is the authority — it restates the
designer's **Option 1** palette (2026-07-21), which **supersedes** the older
`docs/brand/sabeel-color-usage-guide.jpg` (kept for history only). The same
palette is shared exactly with the sibling time-tracker. **Consult BRAND.md
before ANY design or color decision** — new screens, components, illustrations,
charts, anything. Warm Ivory `#F6EBDD` (foundation) / Soft Sage `#A8B89A` (calm)
/ Dark Raspberry `#83114F` (brand identity, used with purpose) / Antique Gold
`#C6A15B` (sparingly) / Mushroom Taupe `#A58D7A` (support).

**All color goes through semantic theme tokens**, and the app is a **single light
theme — no dark mode** (decided 2026-07-21; the derived dark palette was removed,
not disabled). Never hardcode a color; the ESLint rule will reject it.
`app/src/theme/palette.ts` is the only exception and is where the brand palette
lives. The `Caption`-vs-`Hint` question BRAND.md raised is **settled and
applied**: `Caption` is only for text you could delete without losing
information, 35 sites moved to `Hint`, seven genuinely disposable ones stayed,
and `Body`'s `muted` variant was **removed** rather than left unused. `text.muted`
itself is deliberately NOT darkened — that would collapse it into
`text.secondary`.

- **Ordinary actions are icons, not labelled buttons.** Edit, delete, move,
  archive, assign, close — these have settled conventions, and a full-width
  labelled button for each costs a row of vertical space every time. This was got
  wrong three separate times (comment actions, the description editor, the
  bulk-selection bar) before it was written down, and a fourth on the board
  itself. Give every icon an `accessibilityLabel` carrying the word it replaces.
  Use `IconAction` in `components/ui.tsx`, which lays out a real **44x44 box** —
  deliberately NOT `hitSlop`, because neighbouring slops overlap and the touch
  goes to whichever one the platform feels like. **Reserve labelled buttons for
  the primary action of a screen** — `+ Add card` is the board's, so it keeps its
  label while everything beside it is an icon.
- **A destructive action needs a CONFIRMATION, not a label** (narrowed
  2026-07-30). An icon plus "are you sure" is safer than a labelled button with
  nothing behind it: permanent delete in the archive shipped as a bare labelled
  button that fired on first tap, one row away from Restore. Confirm, then the
  icon is free to match every other row action.
- **Back is ALWAYS the `arrow-back` icon, labelled `Back`, in the header row.**
  Never the word. `Screen` is layout-only and every screen hand-rolls its header,
  so nothing enforces this — it was split 7 icons to 7 words before it was
  written down. A control that RESETS to a root instead of popping one screen is
  a different action and gets a different name (`All boards`, `Inbox`), which also
  keeps `getByRole('button', { name: 'Back' })` unambiguous.
- **ONE icon ink size — 24 — for every `IconAction`, and the 44x44 box is what
  spaces them.** Four sizes were in use (13/18/22/24) with no rule, three of them
  on the card screen alone. Ink and crowding are independent here: the box is
  fixed, so a bigger glyph fills a target already reserved and cannot push a
  neighbour closer. Crowding is the GAP, held at `space.sm` or more. Raw
  `<MaterialIcons>` used as inline metadata (a paperclip on a card face) keeps its
  own small size; it is ornament beside text, not a target.
- **A control that floats over content must fit on one row WHERE IT CAN, and wrap
  rather than bleed where it cannot.** The bulk bar sits on top of the board:
  every row it takes is a row of board the user cannot see. But six 44px actions
  need 304px and a 320px screen gives 264, so "one row" was not achievable — it
  pushed the page sideways and took its own close button off-screen. Dismiss moved
  up beside the count, which left five actions that do fit. **Note Yoga defaults
  `flexShrink` to 0, unlike CSS**: a row that should wrap will instead overflow
  until something is allowed to give.

## State, queries and data

- **A live query has THREE states, not two.** `LiveState` reports
  `data: undefined` for loading AND error, so `?? []` claims "there is none of
  this" when the truth may be "we could not find out". Every failure also
  publishes to a global banner `Screen` renders — keep that banner OUTSIDE the
  scroll container, or it is invisible to anyone scrolled down. Where the value is
  a figure someone might act on, branch on `status` explicitly.
- Live Firestore reads in `app/src` go through a single `useLiveQuery`/`useLiveDoc`
  module — never hand-roll `onSnapshot` state in a hook (lint-enforced). See
  `docs/INHERITED-STACK.md` for why this is non-negotiable.
- **Every active filter must be visible and removable, even a broken one.** An id
  can outlive what it points at (a deleted label, an archived board), and building
  chips by filtering a live list down to chosen ids makes a dead id vanish from
  the UI while it keeps narrowing the results — empty screen, no cause, nothing
  to tap.
- **Deliberate view state belongs in `app/src/viewState.ts`, not `useState`.**
  `App.tsx` renders one screen per route, so opening a card unmounts the screen
  behind it. A search, a filter or a chosen tab must outlive the unmount or Back
  returns you to a blank screen. Derived updates use the FUNCTIONAL form — two
  taps in one batch otherwise both read the same snapshot and one is lost.
- **A TEXT DRAFT BELONGS TO THE COMPONENT THAT OWNS THE FIELD — never to the
  screen.** A draft changes on every keystroke, so a screen holding one re-renders
  every live-query list, markdown render and `.map` it draws, per character.
  Measured: 45ms/char on a card with 25 comments (a ~22 char/second ceiling,
  reported from a phone as "unusable on Android, like a slide show on web"), and
  21.1 vs 4.8 ms/char for the comment box on a busy card against an empty one.
  Own the draft locally and take `run`/`busy`/`onError` from the parent. Three
  shapes, chosen by lifecycle: `ColumnNameEditor` (one `string | null` owns
  editing AND the text, so they cannot disagree), `BoardNameEditor`/`AddCardForm`
  (unmount-scoped — the component renders only while editing, so the lifecycle IS
  the reset and a dirty flag would be wrong), and `CardDescription` (draft + dirty
  + reseeding effect, ONLY where the parent keeps it mounted and re-feeds the
  server's copy).

  **This does not contradict the `viewState.ts` rule; they are complements, and
  the distinction is survival.** A search or a chosen tab must OUTLIVE the
  unmount, so it goes in the store. A draft is discarded on cancel and must NOT
  outlive it, so it stays local. `scripts/typing-perf-e2e.mjs` guards this by
  asserting a RATIO between a busy screen and an empty one — never absolute
  ms/char, which moves over 3x per run on a shared runner. Do not "protect" a
  screen by memoising its lists instead: that was tried, it works, and it leaves
  inert machinery plus a standing requirement that every prop stay referentially
  stable forever. The three such wrappers were removed once the drafts moved, and
  the ratios held.
- **An editor closes only once its write LANDS.** Closing first and handing the
  write up afterwards means a failed save takes your text with it and leaves an
  error pointing at something you can no longer see. So `close()`/`setDraft(null)`
  goes INSIDE the `run` callback, after the `await`. This is why editors take
  `run` plus a raw write that may reject, rather than a pre-wrapped one: `run`
  resolves even on failure, so anything sequenced after it runs regardless.
- **Card ordering is fractional string ranks** in `@sabeel/shared`; a move is one
  document write. Never reintroduce an array-of-ids ordering.
- **Stats are server-written, ADMIN-gated, and must never be able to break what
  they count.** `recordStat` runs AFTER the primary work commits and never
  rejects: `guardedEvent` rethrows, so a throw inside a trigger retries it, and
  `onCardWritten` writes activity with generated ids — a retry would duplicate a
  card's history rather than repair it. On the attachment paths the counter sits
  inside the existing winner-only transaction branches, never above them. Day keys
  use `ORG_TIMEZONE`. Drift is acceptable only because
  `scripts/backfill-stats.mjs` rebuilds any range from the source documents;
  `bytesRemoved` is the one series that cannot be reconstructed.

# Working in this repo

## Stack (locked — mirrors the time tracker)

- **Android 13 (API 33) is the floor**, set explicitly in
  `app/android/app/build.gradle` rather than inherited from Expo's default of 24.
  Android 12 and older are unsupported (decided 2026-07-27). That is what lets the
  photo picker be permission-free and both external-storage permissions be removed
  outright — on 13+ the system photo picker needs neither.
- One Expo codebase (`app/`) on **three** surfaces: Android (local Gradle builds,
  committed `android/`), **iOS** (added 2026-08-01, local Xcode builds on a cloud
  Mac, `app/ios/` gitignored) and web via react-native-web
  (`expo export --platform web` → Firebase Hosting). **NO EAS** on any of them.
  Platform seams as `.web.ts(x)` siblings.
- **`app/android/` is committed and hand-edited; `app/ios/` is a build product.**
  So `npx expo prebuild` must ALWAYS be scoped: `--platform ios`. Prebuild
  defaults to **clean** — it deletes and regenerates the native folder, and
  `--no-clean` is the opt-out — but it only clears the platforms you name. A bare
  prebuild therefore wipes `android/` and silently drops `minSdkVersion 33`.
  Because `ios/` is regenerated, **nothing changed in Xcode's UI survives**;
  anything that must persist belongs in `app/app.json`. `docs/IOS-BUILD.md` is the
  runbook, and `npm run check:ios` guards the config that fails late.
- **One version string for all three surfaces.** `expo.version` only — never
  `ios.version`, which would override it and show Apple a different number.
  `scripts/check-version.mjs` already holds the version to Apple's `X.Y.Z` shape.
  `ios.buildNumber` is separate and must increase on every upload.
- Firebase **JS SDK on all surfaces** (not react-native-firebase — no web support).
- Backend: Cloud Functions (TS, nodejs22, us-central1) + Firestore + **Cloud
  Storage** (card attachments). The bucket must be a modern
  `*.firebasestorage.app` one in us-central1/us-west1/us-east1 — only those get
  the no-cost quotas. Sentry on web/native/functions.
- Monorepo (npm workspaces): `app`, `functions`, `packages/shared`. Shared types
  and any cross-surface pure logic live in `@sabeel/shared` — the app and
  functions must never each hold their own copy of a rule.
- Role and status live in **custom claims** (rules trust the token), mirrored
  onto the user doc for UI display only. The sign-in and approval rules
  themselves are stated once, under Authority above.
- Config-as-code: `firestore.rules` / `firestore.indexes.json` / `storage.rules`
  deploy from the repo, never console-edited.
- Versions to match: Expo ~57, RN 0.86, React 19.2, firebase ^12,
  firebase-functions ^7, TypeScript ~6.0, Vitest ^4, ESLint ^9 flat config, Node 22.

## Dev & test loops

`docs/DEVELOPING.md` is the full guide, including how to install the toolchain on
a new machine.

- Unit: `npm test` (Vitest: functions + shared).
- Rules/integration: `npm run test:emulator` (needs JDK 21).
- Web: `npm run dev:web` (or `scripts/dev.sh web`) — these set
  `EXPO_PUBLIC_USE_EMULATORS=1`. Bare `npx expo start --web` in `app/` does NOT,
  and points at **production Firebase**; nothing in the UI says which backend you
  are on.
- Android: `scripts/emulator.sh headless` (AVD `tb_emu`), then
  `npm run android -w @sabeel/app`. Firebase emulators from the AVD = `10.0.2.2`.
  There are NO physical devices. **Check `emulator -accel-check` first** — see
  Verification below.
- **Metro port 8081 is shared with the sibling RN projects on this machine**
  (time-tracker, PineTimeCompanion). The emulator reaches Metro at
  `10.0.2.2:8081` — the host directly — so `adb reverse` does NOT redirect it and
  the port cannot be moved without rebuilding the native app. Whoever holds 8081
  serves this app. `scripts/preflight-metro.mjs` (wired into `npm run
  android`/`start`) refuses to start when 8081 belongs to another project. Symptom
  if bypassed: a red screen quoting *another repo's* module paths after a
  perfectly successful build.
- CI (GitHub Actions): lint + typecheck + unit + emulator + every e2e suite on
  every push. Keep it green. No deploys from CI.
- **A suite nothing invokes is not coverage.** `functions/test/unit/suite-coverage.test.ts`
  guards the emulator lists and `app/src/ciCoverage.test.ts` guards the e2e ones;
  add to both when adding a suite. `app/` runs plain `.ts` unit tests only —
  anything needing a renderer belongs in an e2e suite.

## Verification — what counts as evidence

**Never claim a screen works because the code looks right.** Look at a rendered,
authenticated screenshot. A colour change once shipped blind and had to be
redone: content text had drifted to `text.muted` (~2.7:1), every token value was
correct, and only the *rendered* authenticated screen showed it.

**A check that cannot fail is a screenshot generator.** The tour that
`screens-e2e.mjs` replaced sat entirely inside a try/catch that logged and
continued, so it reported success either way — and it had rotted to clicking
"People" as a top-level button long after that moved into the More sheet.

### The width sweep is the DEFAULT check for layout, on both surfaces

```sh
bash scripts/e2e.sh scripts/screens-e2e.mjs      # the CI set
SWEEP_WIDTHS=320 bash scripts/e2e.sh scripts/screens-e2e.mjs   # while iterating
```

Every authenticated screen at five widths straddling the breakpoint — including a
card with the description editor open and one with the comment composer in use,
because an editor is its own layout — each screenshotted to `shots/screens/` AND
asserted: no sideways scroll, no same-layer control overlap, a way out of every
screen, the right board layout. The widths straddle the breakpoint rather than
looking thorough: a layout bug on one side of it is invisible from the other.

**Reach for this on any change to a shared component, the theme, or a layout.**
It is faster and more thorough than a human on an emulator, and it is what makes
the emulator unnecessary for routine work.

### The Android emulator is reserved for the seams a browser cannot reach

Not for routine layout work. Use it for:

| Seam | Why the browser cannot cover it |
|---|---|
| **The rich-text editor** | The only thing split by platform — Lexical vs `react-native-enriched-html` |
| **Flex shrink / wrap / overflow** | Yoga ≠ CSS. See the bulk-bar rule above |
| **Keyboard / IME** | Emulators misreport IME insets; `edgeToEdgeEnabled=true` makes `Keyboard` events no-ops |
| **Gestures** | Long-press-to-select and the column swipe have no web path. The pager *layout* does render on web at 320px — it is the gestures that do not |
| **Native modules** | Image/document pickers, sharing, FCM, intent launcher |
| **Safe area / insets** | No browser equivalent |

Plus **before a release**, and whenever Faisal asks. That pre-release pass is
mandatory, not optional — see `docs/PHASE_STATUS.md` 2026-07-30 for the shape of
one that was actually executed.

**Why this is safe, and exactly where it is not.** react-native-web resolves
flexbox through the browser's engine, so a narrow viewport tests *your layout
intent* but not *Yoga's behaviour*. The one documented native-only layout bug in
this family was precisely that — a button shrinking below its basis, which "never
reproduced under react-native-web at any width" (sibling recording app,
`docs/PHASE_STATUS.md` 2026-07-24). That is the gap, and it is narrow enough to
name rather than to fear.

**Two traps when you do run native:** a debug build loads its JS **from Metro at
launch**, so `EXPO_PUBLIC_USE_EMULATORS` must be set when Metro starts and Metro
must be restarted with `--clear` after config changes; and `expo run:android`
printing BUILD SUCCESSFUL is **not** proof the APK installed (if the shared AVD
drops mid-run, a stale build stays on the device). Confirm with
`adb shell dumpsys package com.sabeelinstitute.kanban.debug | grep versionName`
before trusting a native screenshot.

**The AVD needs hardware virtualization and a VM may not have it.**
`emulator -accel-check` is authoritative; on a host without it the AVD still
boots in software at ~805 s and ~14 s per screenshot, which retires the
screenshot loop while leaving input usable. Builds are unaffected — Gradle needs
no KVM. `../agent-skills/skills/expo-firebase-stack/tools/check-host.sh` gives
the verdict.

## Secrets (zero tolerance)

- **THIS REPO IS PUBLIC** (confirmed 2026-07-29). Everything committed here —
  including every doc, comment and commit message — is world-readable, and so is
  the entire history: removing something later does not unpublish it. Audited on
  that date and clean, and it stays that way only if the bar below is held.
- **Nothing about the nonprofit's real data or people goes in.** No real names or
  email addresses (the fixtures are `faisal`/`sara`/`omar`, none of which is a
  real account), no board or card contents, and **no production figures** — how
  many admins there are, how many cards were created in a week. Recording that a
  count was *verified* is fine; recording the count is not. Screenshots must come
  from the emulator seed, never a real session.
- NEVER ask for, accept, or echo real API keys/DSNs/tokens in chat; never hardcode
  them. Server secrets: output the exact `firebase functions:secrets:set NAME`
  command for Faisal to run.
- Client-side non-secrets (Firebase web config, `WEB_CLIENT_ID`,
  `google-services.json`, `firestore.rules`) are committed **by design** — rules
  are enforced server-side, so this is security by design, not obscurity.
- Client DSNs go in gitignored `.env.local` (key names only in docs).

## Division of labor

- Agent: all code, rules, indexes, tests, emulator runs, CI, exact click-by-click
  console checklists, diagnosing pasted logs.
- Faisal only: third-party consoles (Firebase/GCP/Sentry), OAuth/SHA-1
  registration, anything with production secrets. He is already comfortable with
  all three consoles — give him precise steps, not tutorials. Everything Faisal
  must do himself is tracked in `TODO.md` — keep it current.

## Conventions

- Work ships as **numbered releases**; commit at the end of a coherent change and
  work autonomously within one. Every release gets an entry in the **deploy log**
  at the top of `docs/PHASE_STATUS.md` — `scripts/build-aab.sh` refuses to build
  without one, so a missing entry fails the release rather than being noticed
  afterwards. It is the release notes and the only record of why.
- **The user manual is part of the app.** A change to any screen means
  `docs/USER-MANUAL.md`, then `node scripts/manual-shots.mjs` for its images, then
  `python3 docs/render-manual.py` for the PDF — all three, same batch. Add new
  screens to the generator; an image with no generator goes stale unnoticed.
  User-visible changes ship with their documentation in the same batch as the
  code — never let the manual lag a release.
- Before ANY significant install (global/system/major framework), ask first;
  routine project-local npm deps of the locked stack are fine.
- All repo artifacts (docs, plans, protocols) live in this repo.
- **Deploying needs Faisal's go-ahead** (set 2026-07-25). Do everything up to and
  including the commit, then **stop and show him what is ready**. Once he says go,
  ship **every** surface in one batch; never ask platform by platform. The gate
  exists because a release is only reversible *forwards*, through another release.
  The surfaces are **web hosting, the APK download page, and Play internal
  testing** — `docs/DEPLOY.md` § Shipping a release has the order, and the order
  matters: **push `main` first** (a GitHub Release cannot attach to an unpushed
  commit), and **build the artifacts after the last commit** or they stamp a
  superseded hash onto the sign-in screen.
- **Android ships through Google Play** (decided 2026-08-02), release-signed.
  Build with **`npm run build:aab`**, then **`npm run publish:play -- --internal`**
  — the upload is scripted through the Play Developer API, so it needs no browser.
  `-- --check` proves every gate and the Play permission without uploading
  anything. Play Console is still required for the things the API cannot do:
  granting permissions, and reading the app-signing fingerprints. Play wants an
  **AAB**, not APKs: one artifact carrying every ABI, from which Play generates
  per-device splits. The `splits` block in `app/android/app/build.gradle`
  therefore switches itself **off** for bundle tasks — both on at once fails with
  *"Multiple shrunk-resources files found"*. `build-aab.sh` repeats every gate the
  old publish script held: store-legal version, a deploy-log entry that exists
  *before* the build, and a signature that is not the debug key.
- **Signing: the upload key lives outside the repo.** `signingConfigs.release`
  reads a gitignored `app/android/keystore.properties`. Absent it, a release build
  still works but is debug-signed and logs a loud warning — every build up to and
  including v0.7.4 went out that way, signed with the debug keystore committed to
  this **public** repo. **Play App Signing re-signs with Google's own key**, so
  the SHA-1 that matters for Google Sign-In on a Play install is under Play
  Console → App integrity → *App signing key certificate*, NOT the upload key's.
  Both belong in Firebase; miss the former and sign-in fails with
  `DEVELOPER_ERROR` for Play users only, while local builds work.
- **The GitHub-release APK is the DEVELOPER'S pre-release route** (un-retired
  2026-08-03, reversing the 2026-08-02 retirement). Testers get builds from Play
  internal testing; this channel exists because Faisal must test a release build
  *before* they see it, from a phone, away from the machine — and Play's one
  feature for that, **internal app sharing, refuses this app**: it requires the
  app to have been PUBLISHED, and internal-testing releases do not count. The app
  is a Draft, and for an internal tool it may always be. **The signature rule is
  permanent**: an APK from here is signed with the UPLOAD key, a Play install with
  GOOGLE'S app signing key, and neither can replace the other — uninstall first,
  nothing is lost because all state is in Firestore.
- **Never `git add` a binary** to any repo: committing per-release APKs bloated
  the pages history (~31 MB each) and had to be rewritten out. `*.apk` is
  gitignored in the pages repo as the backstop, and that rule still holds in the
  sibling time-tracker.
- **Any script whose first act after its checks is a public upload needs a dry
  run.** `publish-apk.sh --check` exists because running it to *test* a new gate
  published a build. If a check is worth writing, exercising it must be free.
