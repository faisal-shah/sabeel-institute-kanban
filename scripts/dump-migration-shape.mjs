// Step R1: the recovery manifest, and a redacted SHAPE the rehearsal can replay.

// READ-ONLY. It writes two files and touches nothing in the database.
//
//   migration/manifest-<project>.json   REAL uids, emails, CLAIMS and board
//                                       membership. The safety net: custom
//                                       claims are in no backup at all, so if
//                                       this file does not exist there is no
//                                       record of who held what before the
//                                       migration. Keep a copy OFF this machine.
//
//   migration/shape-<project>.json      The same structure with every name,
//                                       address and uid replaced. Only the facts
//                                       the migration actually branches on.
//
// WHY THE SECOND FILE EXISTS. Every decision the migration makes is structural:
// does this board record an author, is that author still a member, does the
// account hold a role that could already administer a board, do its claim and
// its mirror agree. None of that needs a real name — so the shape can be
// replayed against the emulator, which is what `migration-e2e.mjs --shape` does,
// and the rehearsal then exercises the real scripts against the real structure
// of production instead of against fixtures somebody imagined.
//
// It carries NO card data, no board names, no descriptions and no addresses.
// `migration/` is gitignored, and this repo is public; the shape file is the one
// of the two that would be harmless if that ever failed.
