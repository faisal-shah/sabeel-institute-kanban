# WHY COMMAND LINE RATHER THAN THE XCODE GUI, beyond preference: Xcode runs build
# phases in a SANITISED environment and, since Xcode 15, does not inherit the
# environment of a terminal that launched it. So the Sentry symbol upload cannot
# see its token in a GUI archive — the archive succeeds and uploads nothing, with
# no error. `xcodebuild` inherits the shell, which makes the whole thing one
# reproducible command and is also the shape any CI job would take.
#
# The gates mirror scripts/build-aab.sh. A release should not be able to go out
# of one store with a guarantee the other store's release does not have.
