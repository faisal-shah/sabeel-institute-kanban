// Rename the `manager` role to `organizer`, in custom claims and in the mirror.
//
// Step R7b of the board-ownership migration. `manager` used to mean three
// unrelated things — administer any board, curate org labels, see stats — and
// two of them have moved elsewhere. What is left is "may start a board", which
// is what `organizer` names. There is NO compatibility shim: after the R7a rules
// and functions deploy, nothing recognises `manager` at all, so an account still
// holding it can sign in and do nothing but read the boards it belongs to.
//
// RUN IT IMMEDIATELY AFTER R7a — target under two minutes. That gap is the one
// window where `setUserAccess` cannot disable, reject or restore anyone still
// holding `manager` (it sends role and status together, and the role is now
// invalid). This script is an Admin SDK tool, so it can set status directly if
// the gap ever has to be worked through.
//
// THE MANIFEST IS THE ONLY WAY BACK. Custom claims are in no backup — Firebase
// Auth is a separate system from Firestore and neither PITR nor the daily
// exports touch it (docs/DEPLOY.md § Auth is not in any backup). So the manifest
// is written, flushed and re-read BEFORE the first claim changes, and a re-run
// never overwrites it — it only APPENDS anyone new. The first run holds the true
// pre-migration state, and a second pass after a partial run would otherwise
// record the half-migrated one as the thing to restore.
//
// DRY RUN BY DEFAULT. `--apply` writes.
