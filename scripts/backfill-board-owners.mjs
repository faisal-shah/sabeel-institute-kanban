// Give every board a `boardOwnerUids`, seeded with its creator.
//
// Step R4 of the board-ownership migration (docs/DEPLOY.md § Restoring across
// the board-ownership migration). Board authority used to be an org role; it is
// now this field, so a board without one is administrable by nobody but an
// admin.
//
// ORDERING IS NOT OPTIONAL. The compat rules must already be deployed — they
// admit `boardOwnerUids` to the board key lists. `hasOnly` validates the whole
// merged document, so the moment a board CARRIES a field the rules do not list,
// every client write to that board is refused. The Admin SDK bypasses rules, so
// this script is never the thing that breaks; ordinary people editing boards
// are. That is exactly how the labels migration broke board editing.
//
// DRY RUN BY DEFAULT. `--apply` writes. `--only <boardId>` does one board, which
// is how the canary step proves the compat rules actually propagated — a green
// `firebase deploy` is not that proof.
//
// Idempotent: a board that already has a non-empty list is left alone, so a
// re-run after a partial run finishes the job rather than repeating it.
//
// NEEDS AUTH READ ACCESS as well as Firestore: gate 3 judges an owner-to-be by
// their custom CLAIM, because that is what firestore.rules reads. ADC for the
// project covers both.

 * live, those same writes are checked against `isManager()`. If every owner is
 * already a manager or an admin, the two agree and nobody is offered a button
 * that fails. Board creation has always required `isManager()`, so this should
 * hold everywhere — assert it rather than assume it.
 *
 * READ FROM THE CUSTOM CLAIM, not from `users/{uid}`. The claim is what
 * `firestore.rules` evaluates; the document is a mirror kept for display, and
 * this gate's whole reasoning is about what the RULES will allow. Checking the
 * mirror would pass an account whose doc says manager and whose token says
 * member — the exact case where the new client offers buttons that fail — and
 * would abort on the harmless inverse. A mirror that disagrees is reported
 * either way: `rename-manager-role.mjs` repairs it, and a silent disagreement is
 * worth seeing before a migration rather than after.
