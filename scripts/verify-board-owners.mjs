// Prove the board-ownership migration landed. READ-ONLY — it writes nothing.

// migration can appear to have worked while leaving something unusable, and the

// with no owner looks completely normal until somebody tries to rename it.
//
// `healthCheck` is not this. It counts documents, so it is blind to a
// field-level change, and it re-baselines every run — a corruption alerts once
// at 03:15 and then normalises.
