/**
 * Rebuild the usage counters at `stats/**` from the documents they were derived
 * from, and seed the stored-file totals.
 *
 * TWO JOBS, one script:
 *
 *  1. BACKFILL. Counting starts when the triggers ship, but the organisation has
 *     months of history already recorded in cards, comments, attachments and the
 *     activity log. Without this the chart is empty for weeks.
 *
 *  2. REPAIR. Firestore triggers are at-least-once, so a retry can double-count.
 *     That is tolerable precisely because this script exists: the source
 *     documents still exist, so any range can be rebuilt exactly. Re-running is
 *     safe and idempotent — buckets are computed in memory and written WHOLE,
 *     never incremented.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT REBUILD: `bytesRemoved`. The activity log records that a file
 * was detached and its name, not its size. Removals are counted (`filesRemoved`)
 * but historic bytes removed stay zero. Going forward the trigger records both —
 * and because of that, a re-run PRESERVES any `bytesRemoved` already recorded
 * rather than resetting it. A repair tool that destroys the one series with no
 * other source is not a repair tool.
 *
 * SAFETY
 *  - `--dry-run` is the DEFAULT. Writing requires `--write`.
 *  - It only ever writes under `stats/**`. Cards, comments, boards and
 *    attachments are read and never touched.
 *  - It never overwrites TODAY (or later). The live triggers own the day in
 *    progress, so this can run against production with counting already on.
 *  - It refuses to write if its own reconstruction disagrees with a direct count
 *    of the source collections.
 *
 * Usage (needs gcloud ADC or GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS):
 *   GCLOUD_PROJECT=sabeel-institute-kanban node scripts/backfill-stats.mjs
 *   GCLOUD_PROJECT=sabeel-institute-kanban node scripts/backfill-stats.mjs --write
