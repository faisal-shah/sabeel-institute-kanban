# The APK is a GitHub RELEASE ASSET on the public pages repo — NEVER committed to
# git. Committing binaries per release is what bloated the pages history and had
# to be rewritten out (see CLAUDE.md "Publishing the APK"). This script is the
# only supported way to publish, and it ends with a guardrail that FAILS if a
# binary ever lands in the pages history again.
#
# The asset lives on a fixed rolling tag (kanban-latest) and is replaced each
# build, so the download URL on the site never changes — only the version label
# on the page does.

# ALWAYS use --check to test the script itself. Without it the first thing that
# happens after the gates pass is an upload to the PUBLIC rolling download.
#
# It ALSO cuts the versioned GitHub Release on the app's OWN repo (all four ABI
# splits + notes from the deploy log) — the changelog/archive convention that
# lapsed after v0.1.10. A Release ASSET is not a git blob, so this does not bloat
# history the way a committed binary did; the guardrail above is about git blobs.

# UN-RETIRED 2026-08-03, for one job Play cannot do.
#
# Android ships to the team through Google Play internal testing. But the
# developer needs to test a release build BEFORE the testers receive it, and
# from a phone, away from this machine. Play offers exactly one feature for
# that — internal app sharing — and it refuses this app: it requires the app to
# have been PUBLISHED, and internal-testing releases do not count. The app is
# still a Draft. See docs/DEPLOY.md.
#
# So this channel is the developer's pre-release route, not a second channel for
# the team. Play remains where testers get builds.
#
# WHAT CHANGED SINCE IT WAS RETIRED, and why publishing here is safe now:
# the frozen asset was the last DEBUG-signed build, and replacing it with a
# properly signed one meant anyone who had installed it could not update —
# Android refuses an install whose signature does not match, with only "App not
# installed" to explain it. That happened once, for 59 seconds. The team has
# since moved to Play, so the population still holding a sideloaded build is the
# developer, who knows to uninstall first.
#
# THE SIGNATURE RULE STILL APPLIES, and always will: an APK from here is signed
# with the UPLOAD key, while a Play install is signed with GOOGLE'S app signing
# key. They cannot replace one another in either direction. Uninstall first.
# Nothing is lost — all state is in Firestore.

# 2b) The same three values onto the ROLLING RELEASE itself.

# made — July, and GitHub shows that prominently. Its body was hand-written once
# and said "Current build: v0.1.10" for four months while the asset under it was
# replaced eleven times. Nobody is meant to land there (the download page links
# straight to the asset URL) but it is public, and it read as a build from
# another era.
#
# So the script owns this text exactly as it owns the page's, from the same
# variables, and asserts the result — the page's own labels were added for this
# reason and this surface was simply missed.

Current build: **v${VERSION}** (${SIZE_MB} MB), published ${PUBLISHED}.

This is a **rolling** release: the APK asset is replaced on every build, so the
download link on the site never changes. The tag itself does not move — the
creation date GitHub shows below is not the build date, the line above is.

Most people should install from **Google Play**, where updates arrive on their
own. This build is the developer's pre-release route, published before a release
reaches Play. An APK from here is signed with the upload key and a Play install
with Google's app signing key, so **neither can install over the other** —
uninstall first. Nothing is lost; all state is online.
