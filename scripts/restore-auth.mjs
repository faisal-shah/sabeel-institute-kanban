// Rebuild Firebase Auth accounts from the `users/*` Firestore docs.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Firestore backups and PITR cover Firestore only — Firebase
// Auth is a separate system and no backup includes it. That matters here because
// a uid is not cosmetic: `memberUids`, `assigneeUids`, `createdBy`, `authorUid`
// and the notification inbox all reference it. If accounts were recreated by
// letting people simply sign in again, each would get a NEW random uid and every
// one of those references would point at nobody — a database that restores
// "successfully" and is quietly wrong everywhere.
//
// The roster does not need a separate backup, though, because it is already IN
// Firestore: `onUserCreate` provisions `users/{uid}` with displayName, email,
// role and status, and the doc id IS the uid. So a restored Firestore contains
// everything needed to put Auth back — this script is the reader for it.
//
// It restores two things per account:
//   - the account itself, created with its ORIGINAL uid;
//   - the `role` / `status` CUSTOM CLAIMS, because firestore.rules trusts the
//     token, not the user doc. An account restored without claims can sign in
//     and then do nothing at all.
//
// Usage:
//   # DRY RUN (default): reports what it would do, writes NOTHING.

// Writing is OPT-IN and GCLOUD_PROJECT must be explicit, so this can never fall

// NEVER deletes: an account that already exists keeps its identity, and only its
