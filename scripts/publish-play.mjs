 * Upload the release AAB to Google Play, without a browser.

 *   node scripts/publish-play.mjs --check       # every gate + the Play permission
 *   node scripts/publish-play.mjs --share       # internal app sharing, link only

 *
 * A destination must be NAMED. There is no default: the two differ in who
 * sees the build, so guessing would sometimes publish to the whole team.
 *
 * TWO DESTINATIONS, DELIBERATELY DIFFERENT IN WEIGHT:
 *
 *  --share  Internal app sharing. Returns a download link and touches nothing
 *           else: the Sabeel testers on the internal track do not receive it and
 *           are not notified. This is the "put a build on my phone while I am
 *           away from the computer" case, and the one that cannot disturb
 *           anyone — but it still has to be asked for by name.
 *
 *  --internal  The internal testing track. This IS a release to the team, so it
 *           carries the same gates `build-aab.sh` does and asks before doing it.
 *
 * Internal app sharing needs no edit/commit cycle; the testing track does —
 * insert an edit, upload, point the track at the new versionCode, commit.
 *
 * CREDENTIALS LIVE OUTSIDE THE REPO, like the keystore. This repo is public: a
 * service-account key committed here would be a publish credential for the app,
 * readable by anyone, forever, whatever a later commit removes.
 *
 * The service account needs Play Console's "Release apps to testing tracks"
 * permission, which covers internal app sharing too.
